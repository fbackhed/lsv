        Ideas about the project came up when questions was asked if Svalbard global seed vault will survive in the future. How is it possible to protect the seeds of planet Earth in the future? A research started about Svalbard global seed which acts as a backup on seeds of planet Earth and was build to be independent without human help and last for a long time. There have already been an impact from climate change as permafrost been melting. The consequences of climate change have led to an upgrade of the seed vault and a need of humans at the vault 24/7.
        
    <br><br>
     The projects solution is a seed vault on the Moon with a backup of the seeds from Svalbard. By having the seed vault on the Moon the seeds are safe if something bad is happening on Earth as climate change, virus or collision from asteroids.

  The Facility
        <br>
        The facility is located on the moon to protect seeds from future threats on planet earth. Japanese scientist was the first to find the underground lava tubes on the moon which may hold a suitable environment for a seed vault. The lava tubes can protect the seed vault against radiation from outer space, falling asteroids and extreme temperatures. The temperature is more stable in the tubes with a temperature between -30 and -40 degrees which can help the storage of the seeds. <br>
        The idea is to run Lunar Seed Vault as a part of the company Svalbard Seed Vault. The Norwegian government funds Svalbard Seed Vault with operative help from Crop Trust. Nordgen is responsible for the management of the seed vault and seed operation. Statsbyg hired by the Norwegian government is responsible for maintenance of the facility, day-to-day surveillance and monotoring.
        <br><br>
          The Seeds<br>
        The seeds of Lunar Seed Vault is well protected and will be used in future science about growth in space and history of earth. By having access to the seeds on the moon this can help feed the moonbase without long transports from the earth.
