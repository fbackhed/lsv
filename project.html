        Ideas about the project came up after selecting the UN sustainable development goal 15: Life on land. How is it possible to protect the seeds of planet Earth in the future? A research started about Svalbard global seed which acts as a backup on seeds of planet Earth and was build to be independent without human help and last for a long time. There have already been an impact from climate change as permafrost been melting. The consequences of climate change have led to an upgrade of the seed vault and a need of humans at the vault 24/7. 
    <br><br>
     The projects solution is a seed vault on the Moon with a backup of the seeds from Svalbard. By having the seed vault on the Moon the seeds are safe if something bad is happening on Earth as climate change, virus or collision from asteroids.
