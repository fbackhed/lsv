        Ideas about the project came up when questions was asked if Svalbard global seed vault will survive in the future. Svalbard global seed vault acts as a backup on the worlds seeds and was build to be independent without human help and last for a long time. There have already been an impact from climate change as permafrost been melting. The consequences of climate change have led to an upgrade of the seed vault and a need of humans at the vault 24/7. 
    <br><br>
     The projects solution is a seed vault on the moon with a backup of the seeds from Svalbard. By having the seed vault on the moon the seeds are safe if something bad is happening on earth as climate change, virus or collision from asteroids. In the beginning of the project research was done about the physical construction of today's internet and what the climate change consequences are (which affect svalbard seed vault). Further research were made about how the web can be build better in the future as a centralized web with p2p. The ideas about the possibilities with the future of the web is saved for later projects. This project is displayed on the web of today as we know it and is hosted on github.
